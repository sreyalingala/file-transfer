# file-transfer

Simple file sharing web app with drag and drop file upload.
The Sender can drag a file from the sender's device and a link will be generated for the file, so that the file can be shared to multiple users at the same time. The file can be sent to the receiver through mail provided the mail ID's of both the sender and receiver. The shared link will be expired after 24 hours to provide extra security to the shared file.
